# Estmating the True Causal Impact of Peace Agreements on Violence: A Double Machine Learning Approach

This project analyzes the causal effect of peace agreements on the intensity of violence, using **Double Machine Learning (DML)** to control for confounders and handle high-dimensional panel data. We use lagged data to capture delayed effects and fixed effects to control for individual differences between countries.

Check out the article for a simplified explanation of our method and approach: 

## üìà Purpose & Features
- **Assess Causal Impact**: Use DML to better isolate the true effect of peace agreements on violence reduction.
- **Panel Data Analysis**: Incorporates lagged data and fixed effects for time-sensitive insights.
- **Custom Model Design**: Integrates machine learning models with cross-fitting for robust causal inference.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
- **Python** with `Scikit-learn` for machine learning models
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data processing
- **PanelSplit** for panel data cross-validation

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges & Future Plans
- **Challenge**: Managing high-dimensional, lagged data for accurate causal estimates.
- **Future Plans**: Add interactive visualizations, explore alternative ML models for robustness, and optimize for faster processing.
