# Double Machine Learning for Dynamic Panel Data with Fixed Effects
## Abstract
This study extends the Double Machine Learning (DML) framework by Chernozhukov et al. (2018) to panel data, addressing unobserved heterogeneity and temporal treatment dynamics. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the extended DML approach handles high-dimensional, complex conflict data effectively. 
We introduce a partially linear model for dynamic panel data, incorporating lagged treatment and anticipatory effects as well as one-hot encoded variables for the fixed effects. This model empirically examines the causal impact of peace agreements on violence intensity. Results reveal that the effects from treatment are not immediate and begin to emerge in anticipation of the signing.
